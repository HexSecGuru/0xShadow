### 💡 Technical Approach
* **Cognitive Style:** Visual-spatial systems mapping. I approach software through the lens of the hardware constraints it inhabits.
* **Problem Solving:** High-velocity troubleshooting during "diffuse-mode" thinking; capable of visualizing 3D component interactions and logic flows.
* **Philosophy:** Building resilient, self-hosted environments using reclaimed and optimized enterprise hardware.

### 🏗️ Infrastructure (The Homelab)
*I maintain a local production stack to bridge the gap between development and deployment.*

* **Data Management:** TrueNAS Scale running on restored enterprise hardware.
* **Compute:** Raspberry Pi 4B (4GB) nodes for containerized microservices.
* **Edge Logic:** ESP32 cluster running custom firmware for environmental telemetry.
* **Manufacturing:** Ender 3 V3 SE for rapid prototyping of hardware enclosures.
* **Data Capture:** DJI Mini 4K for photogrammetry and spatial data.
